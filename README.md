# Good product management

This website is the homepage for a series of emails will focus on good product management. I’ll talk about increasing the value of products that improve lives, where we measure value through how much we help people over how much profit we make. It’s likely that this will be of most interest to you if you’re working in a:

- Government department or agency
- Local Authority
- Charity
- Non-profit
- Social enterprise
- Non-Governmental Organisation.

I’ll publish a new episode whenever I’ve got something useful to say and keep quiet when I’ve not. I’d guess you can expect something every 2-4 weeks.
